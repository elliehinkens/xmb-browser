# Static Example of xmb-webkit

Static example output of xmb-webkit game launcher. When xmb-webkit runs, it generates HTML from your roms directory via Python. This example contains what you would expect from roms directory and media from [Skraper](https://www.skraper.net) (roms media scraper) and defined PC games. You can use an online version [here](https://ellie.hinkens.github.io/xmb-browser/), though it's best to download and open index.html in Chrome. Normally  this is run locally using the file:// paths, it's modified to work for both web and locally.
