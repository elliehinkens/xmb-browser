If you win a game at a lower difficulty level, the following game is automatically played at the next highest difficulty level.

Gameplay is top-down and vertical-scrolling. There are no plays or formations to select from before the action begins; the player can take the snap as quarterback or choose one of two players on defense. On offense, the player can either keep the ball on the run, toss it to one of the two running backs, or throw long to the receiver; an interception turns the ball over to the other team. If a touchdown can&#x27;t be scored, then the directional kicking system can be used to punt the ball or try for a field goal. One game consists (accelerated real-time) 30-minute halves of play to decide who wins this 10-Yard Fight.">

The game is viewed from behind the plane with you fighting wave after wave of enemy fighters.

In addition to the Pick 10 class system from Black Ops II, Treyarch implemented a character system called &quot;Specialists&quot;, where players can pick from 9 different soldiers, each with either a special weapon or ability unique to them. In a later update, a tenth specialist named Blackjack was added to the game. Blackjack is able to mimic the abilities of other specialists, and is only playable for a short amount of time upon completing a set of challenges. A new &quot;Gunsmith&quot; feature offers aesthetic variations in weapon attachments, allowing various weapon customization combinations. The Paintshop feature allows players to create their own custom prints onto specific portions of a gun, further emphasizing the depth of customization in the game.">

Regardless of the mode chosen, once in the air the player will have control over speed, direction, altitude, gun cannon, missiles and special weapon of their aircraft. A new feature from previous Ace Combat games, is the concept of Wingmen and being able to issue simple orders to them in the air. This allows the player to better coordinated group attacks as well as giving each wingman a personality of their own. Additionally, the player as squadron leader will be asked to make decisions (&quot;Yes/No&quot;) while flying in the air. Between missions, the story is progressed through a series of cutscenes.">

Players are cast in the role of Jack Kelar, member of an elite tactical squad, whose team is assigned to Eastern Europe on a hunt for an American traitor. Rather than slinking through environments making quick, covert strikes, players in Black perform a full-on assault through nine levels of explosive action.

 A total of 13 cutting-edge weapons are available to eliminate the enemy threat, but the most distinguishing aspect of Black is its physics engine: fully destructible environments allow players the freedom to shoot inanimate targets as well as live ones. Instead of firing at a patrol of soldiers, for example, players can instead target nearby vehicles or barrels to trigger explosions, shoot out windows and balconies, and more. As Kelar blasts through the besieged cities, snow-covered wilderness, and other levels, shell casings, glass, dust, and debris will fly across the screen as plumes of smoke and raging fires dot the war-torn landscapes.">

The game concerns the events that follow Jimmy being dropped off at Bullworth Academy, a fictional New England boarding school. The player is free to explore the school campus in the beginning and, later on in the game, the town, or to complete the main missions. The game makes extensive use of minigames. Some are used to earn money, others to improve Jimmy&#x27;s abilities or get new items.



School classes themselves are done in the form of minigames, broken into five levels of increasing difficulty. Each completed class brings a benefit to gameplay. English, as an example, is a word scramble minigame, and as Jimmy does well in this minigame, he learns various language-skills, such as the ability to apologize to police for small crimes. Chemistry also an example, is a button pushing minigame, and if Jimmy does well, he gains the ability to create firecrackers, stink bombs, and other items at his chemistry set in his room at the dorm.">
